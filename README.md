# Project_03
My basic platformer game

Features:
2D plarforming game with unlimited platform generation
Spawning enemies
Basic controls (go left/right, jump, create fireball)
Looped music
Basic animation for moving
Boxes with physics
Main menu
Stats counting
Game over screen if it falls out of bounds or is touched by enemies

Key problems:
No speed limit for player's controls (this causes extreme acceleration, which makes controls a little problematic)
No unique assets (everything was taken from the internet or free resources)
Fireballs just appear in front of the player instead of shooting them
It's possible to just spam fireballs infinitely
Too little space for movement
Not much variety for generating platforms
Boxes are useless and only appear at the start of the game
